### Implementation of the RNM algorithm.

The code also includes functionality to manage the complete life cycle of Bayesian networks. It is important to note that this code makes use of the SMILE Engine - not included here - to make inference. If you want to use the code as it is, purchase a license at https://www.bayesfusion.com/smile/. Nonetheless, the proposed approach to RNM is agnostic.
